REQUIREMENTS
------------

You have install `wagtail-embedvideos` package, use the common command:

You need add `wagtailimages` to the current settings, is by default in any `wagtail` project.

	```python
	INSTALLED_APPS = [
	    ...
	    'embed_video',
	    'wagtail_embed_videos',
	    ...
	]
	```

2.	Run `python manage.py makemigrations` to create the migration for `wagtail_embed_videos` models.

Use `EmbedVideo` API:
--------------------
You can get access to the model in python with the next instructions:

```python
        # Accessing the EmbedVideoField() in the model 'wagtail_embed_videos.EmbedVideo'
        # this is the field used for storing the url of the embed video
        video_based_model_instanse.video.url

        # Accessing the thumbnail image in the model 'wagtailimages'
        # this is a foreign key to model Image
        video_based_model_instanse.video.thumbnail
```

EmbedVideo Block
----------------

You can use `EmbedVideo` in `StreamFields` too, an example:

```python
    from wagtail_embed_videos.blocks import EmbedVideoChooserBlock

       ...

       class EmbedVideoFormatChoiceBlock(FieldBlock):
            field = forms.ChoiceField(
                choices=(
                    ('left', 'Wrap left'),
                    ('right', 'Wrap right'),
                    ('half', 'Half width'),
                    ('full', 'Full width'),
                )
            )


        class EmbedVideoBlock(StructBlock):
            video = EmbedVideoChooserBlock()
            alignment = ImageFormatChoiceBlock()
            caption = CharBlock()
            attribution = CharBlock(required=False)

            class Meta:
                icon = 'media'


        class StoryBlock(StreamBlock):
            ...
            aligned_video = EmbedVideoBlock(label=_('Aligned video'))
            ...
```

Extend EmbedVideo model
