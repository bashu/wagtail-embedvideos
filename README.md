WAGTAIL EMBED VIDEOS
====================

Simple app that works similar to wagtailimages, but for embedding YouTube and Vimeo videos and music from SoundCloud.
It's an integration of [django-embed-video](https://github.com/yetty/django-embed-video).


WARNING
-------

With recent changes to keep up with Wagtail current versions, we do **not** support versions <= 1.6!

If you use previous versions of Wagtail (<=1.6), please consider using v0.2.5 of `wagtail_embed_videos`.


REQUIREMENTS
------------
You have install `wagtail-embedvideos` package, use the common command:

        pip install wagtail-embed-videos

You need add `wagtailimages` to the current settings, is by default in any `wagtail` project.


Quick start
-----------

1. Add "embed_video" and "wagtail_embed_videos" to your INSTALLED_APPS setting like this:

    ```python
    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        ...
        'embed_video',
        'wagtail_embed_videos',
        ...
    ]
    ```

2. Run `python manage.py makemigrations` to create the migration for `wagtail_embed_videos` models.

3. Run `python manage.py migrate` to create the models of `wagtail_embed_videos` app.

4. Using `wagtail_embed_videos`:

    ```python
        from wagtail_embed_videos.edit_handlers import EmbedVideoChooserPanel

        class VideoBasedModel(models.Model):
            video = models.ForeignKey(
                'wagtail_embed_videos.EmbedVideo',
                verbose_name="Video",
                null=True,
                blank=True,
                on_delete=models.SET_NULL,
                related_name='+'
            )
            ...
            panels = [EmbedVideoChooserPanel('video')]
    ```
        
5. For render your video in a template put `{% load embed_video_tags%}` for load template tags and put this code where you want render your video:

    ```html
   {% video VideoBasedModel.video.url as video %}
        {% video video 'small' %}
   {% endvideo %}
   ```
        
6. Check [django-embed-video](https://github.com/yetty/django-embed-video) for more documentation.


Use `EmbedVideo` API:
--------------------
You can get access to the model in python with the next instructions:

```python
        # Accessing the EmbedVideoField() in the model 'wagtail_embed_videos.EmbedVideo'
        # this is the field used for storing the url of the embed video
        video_based_model_instanse.video.url

        # Accessing the thumbnail image in the model 'wagtailimages'
        # this is a foreign key to model Image
        video_based_model_instanse.video.thumbnail
```


EmbedVideo Block
----------------
You can use `EmbedVideo` in `StreamFields` too, an example:

```python
    from wagtail_embed_videos.blocks import EmbedVideoChooserBlock

       ...
    
       class EmbedVideoFormatChoiceBlock(FieldBlock):
            field = forms.ChoiceField(
                choices=(
                    ('left', 'Wrap left'),
                    ('right', 'Wrap right'),
                    ('half', 'Half width'),
                    ('full', 'Full width'),
                )
            )
        
        
        class EmbedVideoBlock(StructBlock):
            video = EmbedVideoChooserBlock()
            alignment = ImageFormatChoiceBlock()
            caption = CharBlock()
            attribution = CharBlock(required=False)
        
            class Meta:
                icon = 'media'
    
    
        class StoryBlock(StreamBlock):
            ...
            aligned_video = EmbedVideoBlock(label=_('Aligned video'))
            ...
```


Extend EmbedVideo model
-----------------------
You can extend the `EmbedVideo` model in the same way that `wagtail` image models. Use this setting:
`WAGTAILEMBEDVIDEO_VIDEO_MODEL`.
